👨‍💻 Hello, I'm @johndev2, a passionate back-end developer.
🚀 Currently, I'm delving deeper into JavaScript, while also having experience in C, C++, Python, Golang, and Java.
🎓 I'm a Computer Engineering student in my fourth semester at @ SENAI CIMATEC (https://www.senaicimatec.com.br/en/).
🤖 Beyond web development, I also have an interest in programming for microcontrollers.
📧 Contact me to discuss projects or exchange ideas: john@aln.senaicimatec.edu.br

📚 My journey in technology and programming is a long story, too extensive to be captured in just a few lines. It's been a fascinating ride that started from a young age, driven by curiosity and a deep desire to understand the workings of the digital world.

🌐 This interest has led me to explore various aspects of technology, especially networks and cybersecurity. I've recently delved deep into network studies, uncovering a wealth of discussions around privacy and more.

👨‍💻 On this GitHub, I'll be sharing not only projects in Node.js, which I'm most familiar with, but also projects related to cybersecurity, among others.
