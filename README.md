👨‍💻 Hello, I'm @johndev2, a passionate back-end developer.
🚀 Currently, I'm delving deeper into JavaScript, while also having experience in C, C++, Python, Golang and Java.
🎓 I'm a Computer Engineering student in my fourth semester at @ SENAI CIMATEC (https://www.senaicimatec.com.br/en/).
🤖 Beyond web development, I also have an interest in programming for microcontrollers.
📧 Contact me to discuss projects or exchange ideas: john@aln.senaicimatec.edu.br

🖥️ I've been using computers since 2010, which became my refuge during tough times, notably after the passing of my father when I was 8 years old.
🔒 My journey into hacking and programming began when a peer took down and threatened me over a Skype call to give him admin access to a Minecraft server I was hosting. This incident left me without internet at home for 7 days. After resolving the issue, I dedicated several days to study and successfully managed to disrupt his internet connection for a month using a DDoS attack via Perl, which was relatively easy back then.

🌐 This sparked my interest in understanding more about networks, a curiosity that I put aside for a while but have recently pursued avidly. I've delved deep into network studies, uncovering a wealth of discussions around privacy and more.

👨‍💻 On this GitHub, I'll be sharing not only projects in Node.js, which I'm most familiar with, but also projects related to cybersecurity, among others.
